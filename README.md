Getting Started on GitHub repository

  Don't know why it took me so long to get started here on GitHub. My name is Michael "Mike" Reed and am a student at DeVry. Although I'm in the CIS-Data Management program I like to code when I get the time. So far I've had classes in Visual Basic, C++ and Java. I've also learned a little Python while playing with my Raspberry-Pi and am currently taking a classes on MySql, HTML5 and CSS.
  What actually got me started on all this was trying to learn C on my own so I could program Pic micro-processors for Radio Control projects. When it got too complicated I wanted to know more. The more I learned the more I wanted to know.
